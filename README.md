API-of-BCVTB
============

The goal of this project is to develop a RESTful API for the Building Control Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB), a building energy management system which aims at building a simulation software and benchmark the performances. The reason why building the API is that generally, it requires additional and special knowledge of both control development and software engineering to build a simulation software which allows users to accurately evaluate the energy performances of buildings. However it is hard for developers who build software controls for buildings to become a building simulation software experts at the same time. The possibility to validate and benchmark sophisticated control algorithms on detailed building software models with a reduced modelling experience and knowledge could benefit building users, energy system designers and software engineers.  In this project , in order to make it easier for users to build a simulation software a RESTful API which is connected to BCVTB through MySQL database is built in PHP using Laravel framework. Besides, a java program is built to test the API and the connection with BCVTB.
